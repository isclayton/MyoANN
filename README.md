# MyoANN
Very messy code to train an ANN using one or more Myo armbands, then use that to classify individual finger position.  These positions are then mapped to OpenSim-compatible formats and sent to remote system running hand model. The result is that a user wearing Myo can control a 3d skeletal model remotely.
This code is not complete, but I wanted to store it where it would be safe so it doesnt get lost in the abyss that is my computer. You may think of this as me setting a little grubby code-bird free to the Internet. My sincere apologies..
